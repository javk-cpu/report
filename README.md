## Instruction Set Architecture

Before writing any Verilog, we first needed to describe a somewhat
rigorous Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).  Ideally, such an abstract
model would exist before writing anything in a Hardware Description
Language (HDL) since it serves as the basis for how software controls a
Central Processing Unit (CPU).  Given that this was our first time
designing a CPU from the ground up, much of the ISA was in constant flux
as we slowly converged on our final design.
